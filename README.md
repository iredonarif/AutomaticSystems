# AutomaticSystems
The repository contains 2 basic automatic systems running on terminal: automatic cash &amp; automatic teller machine (ATM).

I coded this basic systems during my first year of computer science to increase my skills in programming with Python.
Let's explain how these systems work:

## Automatic cash
It asks one by one the price of each product purchased. After that, calculate the total amount and 
return the detail(bill or coin) of the change to be returned.

To stop entering prices and let the system calculate; the user must enter the character 0.

## Automatic Teller Machine
It's a basic and custom implementation of bank's automatic teller machine like Ecobank.
It has 4 use cases:
* Create an account
* Make a deposit into the account
* Check the balance
* Make a withdrawal

To make it simple, all data are saved in a file
